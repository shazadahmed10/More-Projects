## Business Problem

### Scenario:
You are a Data Analyst at a mid-sized health insurance company. Leadership is concerned about rising prescription drug costs and the impact on member satisfaction and overall healthcare spend. They want a deeper understanding of prescription usage, provider patterns, and member adherence to medications to identify cost-saving opportunities and improve member outcomes.

### Objective:
Analyze prescription claims data, member demographics, and provider information to identify trends, outliers, and opportunities for intervention.

### Metrics to Analyze

1. Average Monthly Prescription Spend per Member – Helps identify high-cost members or drug categories.
2. Medication Adherence Rate – Percent of members filling prescriptions on time (e.g., medication possession ratio).
3. Provider Prescribing Patterns – Number of prescriptions and average spend per provider; highlight outliers.
