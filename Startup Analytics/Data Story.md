# ðŸ“Š Data Story: SaaS Subscription Analytics

## Business Context

This SaaS company operates on a subscription model with monthly recurring revenue (MRR). Leadership is interested in three key areas:

1. Revenue health â€“ Is MRR growing or declining?
2. Customer retention â€“ What is our churn rate over time?
3. User engagement â€“ Do active usersâ€™ product interactions correlate with revenue outcomes?
