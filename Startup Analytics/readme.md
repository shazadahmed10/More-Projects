# Startup Analytics 

## Purpose: Showcasing analytics that may be examined in a startup company
## Process: Import and manipulate in SQL lite (silver dataset), then create visuals in PowerBI 

## Business Questions to Answer
**Growth & Acquisition**

1. How many new users are signing up each month?
2. Which acquisition channels drive the most paying users?
3. Conversion rate from free → paid → premium?

**Revenue & Retention**

1. What is Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and how is it trending?
2. What is churn rate (users canceling subscriptions)?
3. What is the average customer lifetime value (LTV)?

**Engagement & Product Insights**

1. Do engaged users (more logins/feature clicks) churn less?
2. Which features correlate most with retention?
3. Which customer segments (country, channel, plan) are most at risk of churn?

## Key Metrics to Build

1. MRR = sum of active monthly fees in each month.
2. Churn Rate = canceled subscriptions ÷ active subscriptions.
3. LTV (simplified) = average monthly revenue per user × average lifespan (months).
4. CAC Efficiency (if you want a stretch goal): cost per acquired user by channel (assume paid ads cost X).
5. Engagement Metrics: avg logins/feature clicks per user per plan type.
